# vendor/

This `vendor/` folder contains locally-cached third-party sources and documentation used for offline reference (for example, a copy of the Mutagen API docs).

These files are intentionally kept locally for developer convenience and are ignored by Git via `.gitignore` so they are not committed to the repository.

If you want these docs tracked in the repository instead, remove `/vendor/` from `.gitignore` and commit the files explicitly.
