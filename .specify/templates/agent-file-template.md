## Active Technologies

[EXTRACTED FROM ALL PLAN.MD FILES]

## AI Research Guidance

- When an agent or developer must consult Mutagen source code, generated C# files, or
	schema/record definitions, they MUST use the GitHub MCP server to query the
	`Mutagen-Modding/Mutagen` repositories for authoritative implementation details. Do
	not rely on uncited snippets; include MCP query references in the research notes.
